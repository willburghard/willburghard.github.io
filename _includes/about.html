                Welcome to my website! My name is Will Burghard and I am a programmer and musician based in New York City. I built this website using Github Pages, Jekyll, and Bootstrap to showcase some of my coding projects.
        With regards to programming, I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and have extensive experience with several programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and SQL, as well as a working knowledge of several others, including C# and Haskell. I have a BA in Computer Science from Bard College. You can find a compilation of my various programming projects by navigating to the "Portfolio" section of this website.
        With regards to music, I play in an alternative rock band called "Retracer" and make ambient/experimental music under the moniker "World's Museum."
        I hope you have fun exploring my website!
