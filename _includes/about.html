                Welcome to my website! My name is Will Burghard and I am an Audio Visual Technician, Programmer, and Musician based in New York City. I built this website using Github Pages, Jekyll, and Bootstrap to showcase some of my coding projects.
                I worked as an Audio Visual Technician from 2022-2024 at <a href="https://southridgeaudioproductions.com">Southridge Audio Productions</a>.
        With regards to programming, I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and have extensive experience with several programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and SQL, as well as a working knowledge of several others, including C# and Haskell. I have a BA in Computer Science from Bard College. You can find a compilation of my various programming projects by navigating to the "Portfolio" section of this website.
        With regards to music, I play in an alternative rock band called "Retracer" and make ambient/experimental music under the moniker "World's Museum."
        I hope you have fun exploring my website!
